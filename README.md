# swordfight-simulator
This is a simulation software, built using Unity 3D, Microsoft Kinect and C#, for sword fight training purposes.

It was developed in August 2018, as an internship project at Shri Venkateshawara University, India. The simulator uses Kinect as an input to detect user arm gestures to control the protagonist. It consists of a training phase, in which the user is randomly attacked from different angles, and they are supposed to practice dodging the attack. In the second phase, multiple enemy droids approach the user who has to defend itself and destory them to successfully complete the quest.

Graphical resources have been included from various open source online platforms.
